                        <small>Thanksgiving Day - is typically thought of as a national holiday, however, the idea of giving thanks also is an essential part of daily Catholic life. As a Church family, we celebrate a thanksgiving meal every Sunday within the context of the Mass which is first and foremost a prayer of thanksgiving. <br><br>Petition - Intercessions are prayers of petition in which Christians intercede for the needs of others (e.g. the community, the church, the world, leaders) as well as for themselves. <br><br>Mass for the soul - Mass intentions are requests by relatives and/or friends for particular weekday or Sunday Mass to be offered for the repose of the soul of a deceased person. Mass intentions may also be requested for the living. <br><br>Funeral - Funeral Mass has the body of the deceased or the cremated remains of the deceased present and has all the special prayers attributed to that Mass. When the body or the cremated remains are not present it is called a Memorial Mass.</small>
