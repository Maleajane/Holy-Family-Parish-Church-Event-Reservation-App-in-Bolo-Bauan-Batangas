                   <small>Infant Baptism - is the practice of baptising infants or young children. Infant baptism is also called christening by some faith traditions. Most Christians belong to denominations that practice infant baptism. <br><br>Adult Baptism - Believer's baptism or adult baptism is the practice of baptizing those who are able to make a conscious profession of faith, as contrasted to the practice of baptizing infants. Credobaptists believe that infants incapable of consciously believing should not be baptized.</small>

                    <small>Thanksgiving Day - is typically thought of as a national holiday, however, the idea of giving thanks also is an essential part of daily Catholic life. As a Church family, we celebrate a thanksgiving meal every Sunday within the context of the Mass which is first and foremost a prayer of thanksgiving. <br><br>Petition - Intercessions are prayers of petition in which Christians intercede for the needs of others (e.g. the community, the church, the world, leaders) as well as for themselves. <br><br>Mass for the soul - Mass intentions are requests by relatives and/or friends for particular weekday or Sunday Mass to be offered for the repose of the soul of a deceased person. Mass intentions may also be requested for the living. <br><br>Funeral - Funeral Mass has the body of the deceased or the cremated remains of the deceased present and has all the special prayers attributed to that Mass. When the body or the cremated remains are not present it is called a Memorial Mass.</small>
