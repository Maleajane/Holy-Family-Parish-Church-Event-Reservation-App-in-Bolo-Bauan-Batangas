<h1 align="center"> Holy Family Parish Church Event Reservation App in Bolo, Bauan, Batangas </h1>

## Brief Description of the Project

<p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Holy Family Parish is a Roman Catholic Church located in Balintawak Street, Brgy. Bolo, Bauan, Batangas. It is composed of the faithful people of eighteen (18) barangays in Bauan, Batangas, under the pastoral care and guidance of Rev. Fr. Emmanuel M. Vergara. Currently, they are experiencing numerous in-person church event reservations which causes certain problem in which way they managed their reservation through paper-based manual process. With their traditional manual method, the process of reserving a church event is time-consuming, expensive, increases the possibility for human error and involves physical contact with others. These significant challenges can easily be solved by utilizing modern technology to increase the efficiency and decrease the time for process.

<p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Holy Family Parish app is a mobile web application that allows the user to reserve for a specific church event and help them solve underlying problems with their traditional manual method. HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Bootstrap will be use for the structure of the system and layout. It also includes the use of Angular and Ionic, TypeScript and JSON for the database. It will also help them to manage the reservations easily, organize schedule of church events, provide accuracy of information and security to protect their data safer among all digital user. The ultimate goal is to enhance their current church operations through a mobile web application to accommodate the needs of the congregation to make church event reservation and access to other services at their convenient time.

**Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) - Goal 17: Partnerships for the Goals**

<p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This project will be based on Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 17, “Partnerships for the Goals”, which calls for a global partnership for sustainable development. Furthermore, SDG 17 emphasises the importance of access to science, technology and innovation, in particular internet-based information and communications technology. The project seeks to contribute to the achievement of SDG 17 by developing a mobile web application that is user-friendly, accurate and efficient to enhance and streamline the church operations by providing them with an easy and convenient way to access the church’s services virtually.

## Development Model

<p align="center">

</p>

<p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The programmers employed the agile methodology to create the application, which demonstrate the system's development process.  Agile methodology is a software development model that emphasizes flexibility and collaboration between cross-functional teams. The implementation of agile methodology in church mobile application  can significantly improve the efficiency and effectiveness of church operations. The methodology was divided into several parts to be passed through sequentially. Starting with the requirement , design, development, testing, deployment, and  review.

**REQUIREMENTS**
<p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is the initial phase that requirements understanding of the function and ensuring that it has value, as well as gathering the expected data to be seen in the mobile application. The proposed project should include the necessary specifications that the developers may utilize to create the application, including the necessary programming languages, designs, functionalities to produce the desired results.

**DESIGN**
<p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The system was designed in this spot. It is the specification document that was developed to outline the design's technical needs. As advocates work to improve mobile application  interfaces, they explore how to design them while keeping the requirements in mind.

**DEVELOPMENT**
<p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Which as per the design produce the code and combine the codes for the next phase. It is where the system's supporters begin to construct it. Additionally, this process emphasizes the development of the proposed application time by time.

**TESTING**
<p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is where the proponents integrate and test the unit tested code to ensure that it performs as planned. Its purpose is to guarantee that every component of the mobile application  is responsive and performs the desired functions. It is the stage at which the problems of the system are discovered, as well as whether the product satisfies the desired output.

**DEPLOYMENT**
<p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once the project team has tested the application and determined that it has successfully completed each testing step, including functional and non-functional testing, the system is prepared for implementation in a real-world environment.

**REVIEW**
<p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When the application is finished, the developers need to have a testing process in place for the application integration to monitor for potential problems and to determine the aid users, bugs and flaws will be examined and fixed.

<p align="justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The diagrams above were created by the team to demonstrate how users and administrators interact with the program. It indicates that the user can reserve the church event and choose from the available dates. The admin can view the reservations of the users and delete or approve the reservations.
